# Chatting with AI

Chatting with AI (aka "prompting") is more of an art than a science, but here are a few tips to help you get more out of chatting with AI in Trio Agent:

## Use Multiple Chats
Trio Agent allows you to create multiple chats (conversations) for the same app, giving you better control over the context. Create a new chat if your previous one went off track.

## Write Detailed First Prompts
Be as specific as you can, especially with your first prompt. This helps the AI understand what you want.

**Bad prompt:**
> Build an AI food scanner app.

**Good prompt:**
> Build an AI food scanner app. It should have a welcome screen with a carousel, each section with an image and text. The main screen lets the user upload an image, which is sent to an AI to predict the food and calories, and the user can confirm.

## Review the Change
Trio Agent summarizes the changes it makes to each file. Make sure these match your expectations. If the AI does too much or too little, use undo or ask for clarification.

## Try Another Model
If you get stuck, try a different model or start a new chat. No single model is best for all tasks.

## Manage Your Context
For large projects, create new chats or use the summarize feature to keep context manageable.
