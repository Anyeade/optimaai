# AI Models

By default, Trio Agent ships with its own free Agentic model (Trio AI) with a large 2 million context window.

## Setting Up AI Models
Trio Agent lets you choose your favorite AI model from the top AI providers:

- **Google Gemini** (recommended for free tier)
- **OpenRouter** (aggregator, free access to DeepSeek v3, etc.)
- **Anthropic** (strong coding models, paid)
- **OpenAI** (wide range, affordable, some free tiers)
- **Local models** (see [Local Models](/docs/local-models) guide)

### Auto Model
The default model is called **auto**. Trio Agent will pick the most suitable or available model depending on which AI providers you've set up. This is a good starting point, but you can always switch to a specific model.

### Picking the Right Model
No one model is best for all coding tasks. Try several models for optimal results. For the best AI models for creating web apps, check out the [WebDev Arena Leaderboard](https://webdevarena.com/leaderboard).

### Custom Models
You can add any AI provider or model that offers an OpenAI-compatible API. See the [Custom Models](/docs/custom-models) guide for details.
