# Supabase Integration

Trio Agent integrates with Supabase for authentication, database, and server functions.

## Setup
1. In Trio Agent, go to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Connect Supabase**.
2. Authorize access and select your Supabase organization.
3. For each app, choose a Supabase project (create a new one for each app for simplicity).

## Using Supabase
- **Auth:** Add authentication (email/password by default). You can disable email confirmation in Supabase dashboard settings.
- **Database:** Store and manage data. Supabase supports Row-Level Security (RLS) for secure, fine-grained access.
- **Server Functions:** Use Supabase Edge Functions for tasks requiring private API keys (like calling OpenAI). These run on Supabase's servers, keeping sensitive keys out of the browser.

## Troubleshooting
- If you get an error like "No publishable key found for project", reconnect to Supabase and select the right organization.
