# Privacy Policy

Your data is yours — not ours — and its privacy is extremely important to us. Trio Agent never sells your data—never has, and never will. Because Trio Agent is open-source, you can inspect our code to verify that we follow our stated policies.

## What We Collect
- **Telemetry Data:** With your consent, we collect basic telemetry to help us understand usage and identify errors. This includes anonymized data such as feature usage, error reports, model selection, and randomly generated identifiers. No chat messages, prompts, or code are collected.
- **Troubleshooting Logs:** If you use Upload Chat Session, we may collect your chat and select portions of your codebase for debugging. This is used only for support and deleted after about a month.

## How Your Data is Handled
- **Free Version:** Prompts and code are sent directly to model providers (e.g., OpenAI) or stay on your device for local models. Data never passes through Trio Agent servers.
- **Pro Version:** Prompts and code are proxied through Trio Agent servers only for hosted AI models. Logging is minimized and only for abuse prevention. Data is never used to train any model.

## Your Rights
You have the right to know, access, correct, erase, restrict, object, and port your personal information. You can exercise these rights by updating your account info or contacting support.

## Data Retention
We keep your information only as long as needed for the purposes for which it is processed, or as required by law.
