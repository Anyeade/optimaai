# Importing Apps

If you have an existing app that you want to bring into Trio Agent, you can now import it (experimental).

## Supported Apps
- JavaScript/Node.js apps only (no PHP, Ruby, etc.)
- Your app must have an `npm run dev` script.

## How to Import
1. Open your app code directory in your terminal and IDE (e.g., VS Code).
2. Follow the prompts in Trio Agent to import your app.

## AI Rules
Trio Agent relies on a file called `AI_RULES.md` in the root of your project. This file contains instructions that guide the AI as it edits your app. If your project doesnâ€™t have one, Trio Agent will generate it automatically.

## Limitations
- Only JavaScript apps are supported.
- Most modern frameworks (Vite, Next.js) work out of the box.
