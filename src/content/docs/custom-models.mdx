2. Fill in the required information:
   - **ID**: Used internally and cannot be changed later.
   - **Display Name**: What will appear in the Trio Agent UI.
   - **API Base URL**: Usually found in the provider’s documentation.

## Add a Model
1. In the **AI Providers** section of Settings, click on the provider you want to add a model for.
2. Scroll to the bottom and click **Add Custom Model**.
3. Fill in the following:
   - **Model ID**: Must match exactly what's specified in the provider’s API documentation.
   - **Name**: A user-friendly label shown in the Trio Agent UI.
   - **Description**: Optional info for tooltips.
   - **Max Output Tokens and Context Window**: Set based on the provider’s docs.
