# Versioning

Trio Agent automatically creates a new version every time it edits your code. This means you never have to worry about losing your progress if (and when) the AI makes a mistake.

## How to Undo
At the top of the chat panel, you'll see a button showing the current version. Click it to open the version list. Select a previous version to preview, then click undo to revert your code to that state.

Even if you undo, you won't lose any history. Trio Agent's versioning system is always additive, so it's safe to undo at any time.

## How It Works
Every version in Trio Agent is essentially a git commit. The commit message summarizes the changes. Undo creates a new commit similar to a git revert, and can revert multiple commits at once.
