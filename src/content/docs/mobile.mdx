# Mobile App

Trio Agent has experimental support for hybrid mobile apps using Capacitor.

## Should You Build a Mobile App?
Web apps are powerful and easy to deploy, but native mobile apps offer:
- Deeper device integration
- Push notifications
- Offline access

However, native apps are more complex to build and maintain. If unsure, start with a web app using the default React template—you can always upgrade later.

## How to Upgrade
1. Go to the App Details page in Trio Agent.
2. In the Upgrades section, look for **Upgrade to hybrid mobile app with Capacitor** and click Upgrade.
3. If the upgrade doesn't work, you can manually add Capacitor to your app.

## Install IDEs
- For Android: Install Android Studio
- For iOS: Install Xcode (Mac only)

## Open Your Mobile App in the IDE
On the App Details page, you’ll see buttons to sync and open in Xcode or Android Studio. Click the one for your platform.

## Troubleshooting
Refer to Capacitor’s documentation and the guides for Android/iOS if you run into issues.
