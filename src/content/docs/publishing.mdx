# Publishing your App

Step-by-step guide for deploying your app with GitHub and Vercel.

So, you've built something awesome and now you want to share it with other people (or the whole world).

You can deploy your Trio Agent app anywhere, including your favorite cloud provider. Here’s a simple and free way to deploy using GitHub and Vercel:

## Host Your Code on GitHub
1. **Create a GitHub account** if you don’t have one.
2. **Create a GitHub project** (private or public).
3. In Trio Agent, open the app details card and click **Connect to GitHub**. Authorize access as prompted.
4. Click **Sync to GitHub** to push your code from your local computer to GitHub. You can do this anytime to push new changes.

## Deploying with Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) and click **Continue with GitHub**.
2. Import your GitHub project and click **Deploy**. Vercel will auto-detect your framework (e.g., Vite, Next.js).
3. Add any required environment variables (e.g., for Supabase, OpenAI) if prompted.
4. After deployment, you’ll get a live URL (e.g., `trio-app-name.vercel.app`).

## Tips
- Use **Sync to GitHub** in Trio Agent to push new changes and trigger redeploys.
- For advanced workflows, see the [GitHub Integration](/docs/github) guide.
