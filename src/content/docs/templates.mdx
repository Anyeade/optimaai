# Templates Overview

Trio Agent comes with several built-in templates to help you get started quickly:

- **React (Default):** Minimal React/Vite.js app, great for basic apps. For backend functionality, use Supabase server functions.
- **Next.js:** Minimal Next.js app set up with Shadcn and Tailwind. Provides seamless frontend/backend integration and good performance.
- **AngularJS:** Minimal AngularJS app set up with Shadcn and Tailwind.

Choose the template that best fits your needs. For backend-heavy apps, Next.js is recommended. For simple client-side apps, React is a great choice.
