# Debugging

Debugging with AI to fix errors is one of the most important skills in using Trio Agent effectively.

## Describe the Issue Clearly
Imagine you're talking to a human co-worker. Provide as many details as possible so the AI knows what to fix. Include error messages if you have them.

**Bad prompt:**
> fix broken app

**Good prompt:**
> After I click the sign-up button, the page is blank.

## Use the Undo Feature
If something goes wrong, use the undo feature to revert to a previous version. Test often and use undo as needed.

## Try Another Model
If you get stuck, try the same prompt with a different modelâ€”especially a more powerful one like Gemini Pro 2.5 or Claude Sonnet 4.

## Manage Your Context
For large projects, create new chats or use the summarize feature to keep context manageable.
